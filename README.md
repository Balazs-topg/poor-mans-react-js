# React.js Recreation
## Introduction
The primary aim of this endeavor is to rebuild the core functionalities of the popular React.js library from scratch. This project is born out of a curiosity to understand the nuts and bolts that make React.js an efficient and powerful tool for building user interfaces.

## Motivation
By deconstructing and reconstructing React.js, I aim to achieve a deeper level of understanding of the framework's internals. This deep dive will also help me to leverage React.js more effectively in future projects.

## Project Focus
This project is centered around the implementation of functional components, one of the core building blocks of React applications. I will also be implementing useState and useEffect.

## Development Setup
To get started with the development process, you'll need to transpile the JSX code into plain JavaScript. Here i use typescript, but babel would've also worked fine

Here's how to set up the transpilation process:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install typescript
4. Run `tsc -w` to start the typeScript compiler in watch mode

## Educational Purpose
This repository is part of a school project. The codebase serves as a learning tool and a reference for those interested in the inner workings of React.js.
This project also involved me writing a "rapport" which basically summorises what i have done and found-out. [Read it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jAhyUSjy2ixFD2Cwu3xIXRi2NTb1gv5s3ZiWpg0LPe4/edit?usp=sharing) (NOTE: this is quite simplified, it's written for someone who bearly knows what a javascript is lol, also it's in Swedish)
